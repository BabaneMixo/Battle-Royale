# Battle-Royale


About this program

    This is a multiplayer Battle Royale game that will be a demostration and showcase
    of my understanding of Server-Client Architecture and the basic Object Orientated Programming knowledge

    In this game a player will connect to the server and choose the kind of battle royal they want to play.

    DUAL Player this will have two players playing together along side each other, when a player chooses dual play they will have to wait for another players to join the server so that they have team members.
    SINGLE Player this will have one player playing alone against other players on the battle.

    Battle Royal will be a timed battle whereby players will battle each other and players will the least members on the team will loose the game.
